"""Flash a board by port, but only the build that belongs to it.

    python tools/flash_known.py COM33            # reads the MAC, picks the env, flashes
    python tools/flash_known.py COM33 --check    # just says which board and env

Boards move between ports, and a build for the wrong panel leaves a white
or torn screen, or a board that never comes up. Every flash goes through
the MAC first: an unknown board is refused, and the env is never a guess.
Fill BOARDS in from the fleet as it grows; a new board is added here before
it is ever flashed, not after.
