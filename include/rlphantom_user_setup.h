// SquachWatch-CYD — TFT_eSPI config for the RL Phantom
// (Sunton ESP32-2432S024, 2.4 inch, ILI9341).
//
// WHAT THIS BOARD IS. A 2.4" CYD with the SAME display wiring and the SAME
// 240x320 panel as the 2.8" board this project was built on -- smaller glass,
// identical pins. Vendor repo: github.com/NoosaHydro/2.4inch_ESP32-2432S024,
// and these numbers come from its own factory User_Setup.h rather than from a
// guess or a forum post.
//
// WHY IT GETS ITS OWN HEADER when it is nearly a copy of the 2.8" ILI9341 one:
//   - The backlight is on GPIO27, not 21. Harmless either way (main.cpp drives
//     all three known backlight pins on their own LEDC channels precisely so it
//     never has to know which board it is), but a header that says 21 on a
//     board wired to 27 is a lie that outlives whoever wrote it.
//   - USER_SETUP_INFO is what the serial banner reports. A tester saying "it
//     says 2.8 inch" when they are holding a 2.4 is a wasted round trip.
//
// TOUCH IS NOT CONFIGURED HERE, deliberately. This board ships in two flavours:
//   ESP32-2432S024R -- resistive, XPT2046, touch CS on GPIO33
//   ESP32-2432S024C -- capacitive, CST820 on I2C, SDA on GPIO33
// The same pin, two entirely different chips. main.cpp already handles this
// without being told which: it probes for the capacitive controller at I2C
// 0x15 first and falls back to the resistive path when nothing answers (see
// the CapTouch::probe() block in setup()). Both variants therefore work from
// one build, and the serial log says which one it found.
//
// The board reportedly lights up under the AWOK firmware but has dead touch,
// which is exactly what a capacitive panel does when the firmware is looking
// for a resistive one on a shared SPI bus. This build should fix that without
// any new code.
