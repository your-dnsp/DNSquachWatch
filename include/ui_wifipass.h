// SquachWatch-CYD — typing a WiFi password on the board.
//
// Its own keyboard rather than the payphone's QWERTY board, because that one
// is uppercase-only with a handful of punctuation keys -- right for a name or
// a message, wrong for a password, which is case-sensitive and usually has
// symbols in it. This one has SHIFT and a symbols page with every printable
// ASCII mark. It types on RELEASE with the same jump filter the payphone
// uses, because a resistive panel's last samples as the finger lifts are junk.
//
// The text is hidden by default (the last character shows briefly) with a
// SHOW toggle, and uiWifiPassClear() wipes the buffer once it has been used.
