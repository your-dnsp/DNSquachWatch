// SquachWatch-CYD — which of the black box's kept sightings the LOG shows.
//
// The LOG is the engine's RAM ring (this boot) followed by every sighting the
// black box kept in flash. The flash has a record for every time a device was
// first seen or came back -- today's included -- so a device seen yesterday
// and again today showed twice, a grey KEPT row under its live one, and a
// device that comes and goes showed once per visit.
//
// This keeps one row per device (MAC + type): the live row if the ring has
// it, else its newest kept sighting. Built by one walk of the flash when the
// LOG opens and whenever the ring changes, at most once a second.
