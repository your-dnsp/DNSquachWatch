// SquachWatch-CYD — the part of a firmware update that does not care how the
// bytes arrive.
//
// Bluetooth (ota_ble.h) and WiFi (ota_wifi.h) are only transports. Both hand
// their bytes to this installer, and everything that makes an update safe
// lives here, once:
//
//   1. The image streams into the spare app slot while the current one keeps
//      running, hashed as it goes.
//   2. The hash must match a signature made with the project's private key (a
//      GitHub Actions secret); the public key is compiled in, see
//      ota_pubkey.h. The signed message includes this board's build name, so a
//      correctly signed image for a DIFFERENT board is refused too -- a wrong
//      display driver is a white screen, and a white screen cannot be
//      navigated to switch back.
//   3. The ESP32's own rollback. A freshly installed image boots on probation
//      and only confirms itself after running for CONFIRM_MS. A crash or a
//      power cut before then and the bootloader returns to the old slot.
//
// Signed message = SHA-256("SQWOTA1\n" + build name + "\n" + image), ECDSA
// P-256, DER. tools/sign_firmware.py makes them.
//
// It also owns the two-slot bookkeeping the UPDATE FIRMWARE screen shows:
// which version is in each slot, and switching to the other one.
