// (that screen doesn't get the INFO option -- see its own comment for
// why), consistent with this screen already keeping its own geometry/
// scrollbar code instead of reaching into that module.
//
// infoPending/infoTypeName/infoText: drawn INSTEAD of the confirm panel
// (the two are mutually exclusive -- confirmPending is only ever
// checked when infoPending is false) via Theme::drawInfoPanel() -- see
// its own comment (ALERT's MORE INFO button shares that same panel).
// Both strings are ignored when infoPending is false; main.cpp decides
// what they actually are (infoTypeName is null during the one-time
// RSSI/confidence primer page, which isn't about any one type -- see
// DetectionInfo::explain()/rssiConfidencePrimer()), this module just
// hands them through to Theme:: unchanged. Hit-testing its dismiss
// button is Theme::infoPanelHitDismiss(), not owned here.
// confirmWatched: see ui_rawscan.h's copy -- the panel's WATCH button becomes
// UNWATCH when the device it is asking about is the one already being watched,
// and IGNORE becomes UN-IGNORE when it is on the ignore list.
