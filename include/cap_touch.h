// SquachWatch-CYD — capacitive touch (CST816/CST820) driver
// Used on the JC2432W328C board variant, whose touch controller sits
// on I2C (SDA/SCL) instead of the original board's dedicated XPT2046
// SPI bus. No IRQ pin is used — the vendor docs for this board say not
// to wire one, so this driver polls the controller directly.

#include <stdint.h>

namespace CapTouch {
    // Starts the I2C bus on the given pins and pulses the controller's
    // reset line (active-low, per this board's vendor docs). Without
    // this the chip can power up in a stale/undefined state — X moved
    // sensibly across taps in early testing but Y stayed frozen, which
    // looks exactly like an unreset chip. Call once from setup(),
    // before probe().
    // `rst` below zero skips the reset pulse (the T-Watch's FT6336 has no
    // reset line we drive); `addr` is the controller's I2C address, 0x15
    // for the CST816/CST820 and 0x38 for the FT6336, whose registers
    // 0x02..0x06 (finger count, X high/low, Y high/low) share a layout.

    // fall back to the resistive touch path — nothing here should be
    // trusted without a confirmed probe.

    // rotated/calibrated to the display's coordinate space) if a
