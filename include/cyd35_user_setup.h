// SquachWatch-CYD — TFT_eSPI user setup for the 3.5" Sunton-family CYD
// (ESP32-3248S035R — "R" = resistive touch; confirmed against a physical
// unit whose silkscreen reads "3.5" LCD Display / ESP32-32E 320x480 /
// Resistance Touch"). Pinout cross-referenced against esp3d.io's
// sunton-35-3248 hardware page, and several of these pins already match
// known-good constants elsewhere in this codebase for the OTHER board
// variants (SCK/MOSI/MISO/DC/CS identical to the 2.8" board; BL=27
// already exists as BL_PIN_CAP in main.cpp) — one real fresh unknown
// here is the driver chip itself.
//
// UNCONFIRMED ON REAL HARDWARE (post color-inversion-bug-fix): the
// TFT_INVERSION_ON/TFT_RGB_ORDER combo below is a first guess, not a
// verified one -- see main.cpp's PANEL_NEEDS_INVERSION comment for why
// this header's TFT_INVERSION_ON/OFF define alone is dead code for
// choosing polarity (a real bug found on AWOK: tft.invertDisplay() at
// runtime overwrites it unconditionally). If colors still look wrong,
// PANEL_NEEDS_INVERSION in main.cpp is the one to flip, not this file
// -- TFT_RGB_ORDER below is still live and worth trying too.
