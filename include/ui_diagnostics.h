// touching board-specific globals (which raw touch reader, which

// this file just formats and draws whatever it's handed.
// What the board was doing the last time it died.
//
// A panic reset tells you THAT it crashed and nothing else, which is what
// made the first one useless: it happened during a drive, on a build with no
// SquachMesh in it, and the only thing recoverable afterwards was the word
// PANIC. Whether the heap was exhausted, which screen was up, how long it had
// been running -- all gone.
//
// RTC memory survives a software reset (a panic is one) but not a power
// cycle, so a breadcrumb written there each second costs no flash wear and is
// readable on the next boot. It is not a backtrace, but "died at 41 minutes
// with 900 bytes of largest block, on CLEAR" and "died at 3 minutes with a
// healthy heap" are different bugs, and this tells them apart.
