// SquachWatch-CYD — where a frame's time goes.
//
// The [frame] line on serial has always said how long a frame takes and how
// much of it is the push. That left the other 40 ms as one number, and
// nobody had ever broken it down -- every framerate conversation was a
// guess about which of the background, the mascot, the chrome or the radio
// bookkeeping was the expensive one.
//
// This splits it. Each frame is a sequence of laps: the time since the
// previous lap is charged to the named slot. Seven micros() reads a frame,
// which is nothing, and the split prints on its own [frame] line every ten
// seconds beside the total.
//
// Slots are laid out for the main screen, which is the one whose frame rate
// anybody sees. On every other screen there are no laps between PRE and
// POST, so POST is simply "drawing that screen" -- still a useful number.
