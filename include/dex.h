// SquachWatch-CYD — the SQUACHY-DEX: one entry per detection type.

// BINGO is a card you fill once a week. The DEX never finishes: seventeen
// numbered entries, a silhouette for every type never caught, and a card
// behind each with what it is, where it lives, what Squachy thinks of it,
// and this board's own record against it. The counts come from the
// engine's lifetime totals; what the engine never kept -- first catch,
// closest signal, catches at night -- is kept here, one small blob in NVS.
