// SquachWatch-CYD — emotes as scripts: the pure half.
//
// The six original emotes are set pieces with their own code in ui_clear.cpp,
// three of them shared with the clock that starts pieces on its own. The other
// thirty are DATA: a handful of beats each, and every beat says what the two of
// them do for how long, who says what, and what flies about. One small engine
// in ui_clear.cpp plays any of them. Thirty hand-written pieces would have been
// thirty copies of the same timing code, and roughly five times the flash.
//
// Beats are written from the SENDER's side: A sent it, B received it. On the
// sending board A is the host, on the other board A is the visitor, so the two
// screens tell the same story from their two sides -- the same rule the
// original pieces follow.
//
// Everything here is plain tables and arithmetic, so it compiles and is tested
// on a desktop (test/emote_script_test.cpp).
