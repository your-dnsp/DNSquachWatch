// SquachWatch-CYD — the public half of the firmware signing key.
//
// Over-the-air updates are only installed when their signature verifies
// against this key (see ota_core.h). The private half never lives in this
// repository: it is the OTA_SIGNING_KEY secret the release workflow signs with,
// plus the owner's offline backup.
//
// A public key is safe to publish. What matters is that this one and that
// secret are a PAIR: sign with anything else and every board refuses the image.
//
// The real key, generated 2026-09-12 (ECDSA P-256). Replacing it is not a
// quick change: every board in the field only trusts THIS key, so a new one
// reaches them only through a USB install -- or through an over-the-air
// update signed with the old key that carries the new one.
//
// It is kept here as the RAW CURVE POINT rather than as the PEM text it came
// from. Handing mbedtls a PEM means handing it the general-purpose key parser,
// which drags in base64, ASN.1 key structures and RSA -- 15 KB of flash, for
// one fixed key on one curve that this firmware has known since it was built.
// The point below is exactly what that parser would have produced.
//
// The PEM it was taken from, for anyone checking it against the private half:
//

//     MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAExH42akwp2OwUx5sGjUVIJS3VbtXN
//     AVg8Z3YuOKDU/05K3SzLPm/xcWKOi07BROJg6DzekERBobkteEvAHBmwfg==
//     -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
//
// To regenerate the array after a key change (the last 65 bytes of the DER
// are the point; 0x04 marks it uncompressed, then X and Y, 32 bytes each):
//
//     openssl ec -pubin -in key.pub.pem -outform DER | tail -c 65 | xxd -i
