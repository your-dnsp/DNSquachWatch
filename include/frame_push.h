// SquachWatch-CYD — pushing the frame buffer without waiting on the wire.
//
// Every screen is drawn into an 8-bit sprite and shipped to the panel by
// TFT_eSPI's own 8-bit push: convert one line of 8-bit colour into the 16-bit
// words the panel wants, hand it to the SPI hardware 64 bytes at a time,
// and SPIN while each 64 bytes goes out. Then the next line. The wire idles
// while a line converts, and the CPU idles while a line transmits -- about
// 7 ms a frame of each waiting on the other, on top of the 15.4 ms (80 MHz)
// or 30.7 ms (40 MHz) the bytes themselves cost.
//
// This reorders that loop and nothing else: kick 64 bytes, and convert the
// NEXT 64 bytes while they go out instead of spinning. Same registers, same
// bus, same chip select and transaction the library's push already holds --
// it is the library's loop with the wait put to use, not a second driver.
// (A second driver is what the DMA attempt was, and the engine never
// completed a single transfer under it. That path is closed; this is the
// other way round to the same 7 ms.)
//
// Gated to the 2.8" CYDs to start with, by agreement, not by mechanism: there
// is nothing here the other boards' bus could not do, and it can be widened
// once it has proven itself on the two boards it can be measured on.

// Every board, now. The gate started narrow on purpose -- one board at a
// time, each one measured before the next was let in -- and they have all
// been through it: the 2.8" CYDs in v1.15.0, the RL Phantom and the 3.5"
// after that, and AWOK on 2026-09-20, which turned out to be spending two
// thirds of its frame on the wire. Nothing board-specific is left in here,
// so the condition is simply "a board", and a new one inherits it: the push
// is the library's own transaction with the waiting put to use, and it
// declines any frame whose shape it does not recognise rather than guessing.
// Not on an ESP32-S3 yet (SQW_S3: the T-Watch and the Freenove S3): the
// overlapped push talks to the ESP32 SPI registers, and the S3 lays them out
// differently -- the first frame through it came out white. pushSprite()
// until it is ported. And not on the CrowPanel 7, which has no SPI display at
// all: CrowBlit writes rows into its RGB framebuffer (crowpanel7_blit.h).
