// SquachWatch-CYD — Elecrow CrowPanel ADVANCE 7.0-HMI board facts.
//
// ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8: 16 MB flash, 8 MB OCTAL PSRAM, an 800x480 RGB
// parallel panel (no SPI display bus at all), a GT911 capacitive controller
// and an STC8H1K28 helper MCU that owns the backlight, both on I2C 15/16.
// USB-C reaches UART0 through a CH340K, so there is no native USB.
//
// Every number here was measured on this board (2026-09) and checked against
// Elecrow's wiki, their ESPHome YAML and their Arduino examples. Nothing is
// derived, guessed or read off a product page. Mind the look-alike: the plain
// HMI 7.0 (DIS08070H) shares almost no pin with the Advance, and its numbers
// are NOT the ones here.

// ---- Timing ---------------------------------------------------------------
// The pixel clock has a hard ceiling between 16 and 18 MHz on this panel, and
// it is a delivery ceiling (framebuffer reads off the octal bus), not a
// timing-shape one: 20 MHz divides 240 MHz evenly and still runs away
// horizontally; 16 MHz does not divide evenly and is rock steady. Widening
// the blanking does not buy anything past it. Below ~14 MHz the panel stops
// holding a picture at all and cycles black/white/R/G/B.
//
//   15 MHz  36.5 Hz  locks, brightness flickers
//   16 MHz  39.0 Hz  locks, steady          <-- this one
//   18 MHz  43.9 Hz  runs away horizontally
//   20 MHz  48.8 Hz  runs away horizontally
// Elecrow's own porches. Widening them (40/4/40, 16/4/16) was tried against
// the sideways step and did not move it; the cause was elsewhere.

// ---- What the UI thinks the screen is -------------------------------------
//
// The app renders at PANEL / CROWPANEL_SCALE and the blit doubles it up.
//
// Scale 2 (the default): 400x240, doubled to exactly 800x480. The 96 KB frame
// lives in INTERNAL RAM, and that is the point, not a memory economy: on this
// board the picture twitches sideways whenever the CPU writes into PSRAM
// while the panel's DMA is reading its framebuffer from the same bus -- the
// app's scattered per-pixel writes into a PSRAM sprite are exactly that.
// Measured on the bench with a static test picture: stable alone, stable
// with WiFi and BLE scanning underneath, twitching hard the moment the UI
// drew into a PSRAM sprite, stable again with the sprite in internal RAM.
// The blit's own writes are large and sequential and do not upset it.
//
// Scale 1: native 800x480. The 384 KB frame can only live in PSRAM, so the
// picture twitches on this core (arduino-esp32 2.0.14, PSRAM at 80 MHz).
// Kept for a core with bounce buffers or faster PSRAM (IDF 5.x / Elecrow's
// 120 MHz libraries), where it should be the mode of choice.
