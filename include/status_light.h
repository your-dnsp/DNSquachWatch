// SquachWatch-CYD — the RGB LED on the back of the board, put to work.
//
// One light, several things that want it. The rules, highest first:
//
//   1. Off: LIGHT is OFF in settings, or a screen where the light has to
//      stay honest (PIN entry, the lock screen, the wipe). A duress restart
//      looks like any other restart, from the back too.
//   2. A firmware update: cyan blink while bytes arrive, solid green for the
//      seconds before a successful restart, solid red for a failure.
//   3. A detection alert: three fast flashes in the detection's own colour,
//      then steady for as long as the alert card is up, then a one-second
//      fade down. Same colour the card uses, from the theme.
//   4. An unread message: a soft double-blink in the mesh pink every three
//      seconds until the inbox is opened.
//   5. A squad visit: one short blip, then back to idle. Never repeats.
//   6. Idle: off, a slow breathe, or solid, in the idle colour.
//
// The LED sits on GPIO 4 / 16 / 17 on the 2.8" CYD, both the ST7789 and the
// ILI9341 kinds, and on the RL Phantom, where it is on the front. Common
// anode, so the pin goes LOW to light. The Freenove S3 2.8" has a WS2812 on
// GPIO 42 instead, driven with the same rules. The AWOK and the 3.5" are unverified
// and the driver compiles to nothing on them: driving PWM onto a pin that
// turns out to be something else is exactly how the Phantom's touch fault
// happened.
