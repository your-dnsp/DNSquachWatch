// SquachWatch-CYD — firmware updates over Bluetooth: the transport only.
//
// A GATT service the website talks to from a browser (Web Bluetooth). The
// bytes go straight into OtaCore, which owns everything that makes an update
// safe -- see ota_core.h. What this file adds is getting them there:
//
// WHY IT CANNOT RUN ALL THE TIME. Update mode stops BLE scanning, WiFi capture
// and mesh advertising for its duration. The scanner's allocations fragment
// the heap, a busy scanner steals radio time, and NimBLE refuses to register a
// GATT server while a scan is running. So it is a mode entered from the menu.
//
// WHO MAY SEND. The board must be unlocked, and the browser has to send the
// six-digit code shown on the screen before a single byte is accepted -- which
// is what stops a stranger in range pushing an image at a board in update mode.
//
// THE PROTOCOL. One service, three characteristics, little-endian throughout.
//   INFO  (read)            env=<build>;ver=<version>;slot=<label>;max=<bytes>;proto=1
//   CTRL  (write, notify)   commands in, replies out -- see Cmd/Reply below
//   DATA  (write-no-resp)   <u32 offset><bytes>, sent in windows; after each
//                           window the browser sends SYNC and resumes from the
//                           offset in the ACK. A lost chunk costs one window.
