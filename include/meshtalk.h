// SquachWatch-CYD — SquachMesh messages at runtime: the phrase, the key, the
// counter, what is being sent and what has arrived.
//
// The pure protocol is meshmsg.h, the cipher is meshcrypto.h, and the radio is
// the Mesh namespace (mesh.cpp, and detection.cpp's radio half). This is the
// part that holds state, and the part the screens talk to.
//
// Threading: onFrame() is called from the BLE host task and does nothing but
// copy bytes into a small ring. Every decryption happens in tick(), on the loop
// task -- the same task that encrypts -- so the cipher is never used from two
// tasks at once.
