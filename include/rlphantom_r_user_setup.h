// SquachWatch-CYD — TFT_eSPI config for the RL Phantom, RESISTIVE variant
// (Sunton ESP32-2432S024R, 2.4 inch, ILI9341).
//
// Identical to rlphantom_user_setup.h in every display respect -- same panel,
// same pins, same backlight -- with one addition: TOUCH_CS.
//
// WHY THAT ONE LINE IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE. This board's XPT2046 sits on the
// DISPLAY's SPI bus, not a dedicated one, exactly like AWOK's. Arming TOUCH_CS
// here lets TFT_eSPI read raw touch values off that bus, and main.cpp's
// TOUCH_RAW_SHARED_BUS branches then run the 2.8" board's rotation maths on
// them, so touch follows the screen when it rotates.
//
// The standard path would look for the touch chip on GPIO 25/32/39. On this
// board those are the capacitive controller's reset, the I2C clock, and an
// unrelated input -- so a resistive Phantom finds nothing at all there.
//
// WHICH ONE DO I HAVE? The part number ends in R (resistive, this file) or C
// (capacitive, rlphantom_user_setup.h). Only this resistive build is on the
// public flasher; the capacitive one has never run on a real board.

// takes VSPI, and so does the Arduino `SPI` object the SD card uses on
// 18/19/23: two pin sets on one engine. On this board the touch chip reads
// through the display's MISO, so the SD card's pins being attached to the
// same engine killed touch, and handing the SD card the display's engine to
// avoid that meant the card never saw a clock. Two engines, two buses, no
// sharing: the display and touch here, the SD card on VSPI.
