// Every OUI carries its own confidence, because the registrant matters as
// much as the prefix. Roughly:
//
//   HIGH  the block is registered to the company that makes the product.
//   MED   registered to a parent whose range is much wider than the
//         product -- Amazon owns Ring, and also Echo, Fire TV and Kindle.
//   LOW   a module or ODM vendor whose parts are in everything (Espressif,
//         Liteon, Murata, Realtek, Telink), or a block that is not in the
//         IEEE registry at all.
//
// The LOW rows are not mistakes and are not being deleted: Flock really
// does build on ESP32, so the prefix really is evidence. It is just
// evidence shared with every dev board on earth, and saying so is the
// difference between a detector and a rumour.

// AirTag match and Tile's Medium-confidence one, and the engine doesn't
// currently distinguish which matched), this reports the conservative
// (lower) grade rather than overstating certainty.
// Note: plain LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH collide with Arduino core's LOW/HIGH
// pin-state macros via textual substitution (enum class scoping
// doesn't protect against the preprocessor), hence the _CONF suffix.
