// SquachWatch-CYD — SquachMesh messages: the pure half.
//
// Everything here is arithmetic over bytes: the word list, rolling a phrase,
// the frame format, text packing, reassembly, replay rejection and counter
// reservation. The cipher is INJECTED (see Crypto), so this compiles and is
// tested on a desktop with no crypto library at all -- which matters, because
// CI builds and tests it on every push and CI has none.
//
// The cipher itself is AES-128-CCM with an 8-byte tag, keyed by
// PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 over a five-word phrase. On the device that is mbedtls
// (meshcrypto.cpp). It is pinned to an INDEPENDENT implementation -- Python's
// `cryptography`, via test/gen_meshmsg_vectors.py -- by golden frames the
// device must reproduce byte for byte at boot before it will send or read a
// single message. Two implementations that must agree about a format neither
// owns is a test; one implementation checked against itself is not.
//
// WHERE THIS RIDES: the scan response. The limit that shapes everything below
// is BLE 4.2 legacy advertising -- 31 bytes a packet -- because the ESP32 on
// these boards has no extended advertising. After the packet's own length and
// type bytes and the company ID, a frame gets 27 bytes, and TEXT_FRAME_LEN is
// exactly that.

// authenticated -- a whole typed message, not one of its parts -- otherwise a
// forger could poison the table with a huge counter and silence a real sender
// for good. A typed message records its LAST counter, so its own parts arriving
// again afterwards are stale.
//
// Kept across a reboot: meshtalk.cpp writes the table to flash after every
// message it records. It used to be RAM only, so a frame recorded by somebody
// else and replayed at a freshly booted receiver was shown once more. What is
// still true: the table holds four senders, and one pushed out by four newer
// ones is forgotten, so its old frames count as new again.
