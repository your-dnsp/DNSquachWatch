// SquachWatch-CYD — GNSS: the T-Watch S3 Plus's GPS, as a position and a time.
//
// The parser is plain C++ with no hardware in it, so the host tests feed it
// sentences. The part that powers the module and reads its UART lives behind
// TWATCH_S3 (see gnss_hw in main.cpp's watch section); on every other board
// nothing ever calls feed() and fix().valid stays false.
//
// NMEA 0183 as the u-blox M10 sends it by default: GGA for the fix, the
// satellites used and the height; RMC for the date, which GGA does not carry;
// GSV for what is in view. Talker IDs (GP, GN, GL, GA, GB, BD, GQ) are all
// accepted -- the M10 reports its combined solution as GN.
