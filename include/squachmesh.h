// SquachMesh -- the wire format two SquachWatches use to recognise each
// other and describe their own Squachy well enough for the other device to
// draw it.
//
// This header is the whole protocol. It deliberately contains no radio: the
// codec is arithmetic over a byte buffer, which is what lets the host tests
// in test/squachmesh_test.cpp cover every refusal path without a board.
//
// WHY IT IS THIS SMALL. Everything about Squachy's appearance is already a
// curated index rather than free text -- ten nicknames, fourteen outfits,
// four shade colours -- and both devices ship the identical tables. So the
// only thing that has to travel is WHICH ENTRY, and the whole appearance
// packs into a single 16-bit word. The name bytes exist only for the
// minority of devices whose owner typed their own.
//
// The payload rides in BLE manufacturer-specific data under company ID
// 0xFFFF. That ID is reserved by the SIG for exactly this kind of
// non-production use, and is the honest choice for a project with no
// registration of its own -- this codebase already documents what happens
// when somebody squats a registered ID they do not own: Marauder labels
// Flipper's company as 0x0FBA, which belongs to a headset manufacturer, and
// every project that copied the constant inherited the mistake.
//
// 0xFFFF is shared with every other hobby project that made the same call,
// which is precisely why MAGIC is not optional.
