// SquachWatch-CYD — TFT_eSPI user setup
// Some ESP32-2432S028R ("CYD") batches — including the AITRIP-branded
// board this repo was field-tested against — ship an ST7789 panel
// instead of ILI9341, same 2.8"/240x320 glass and pinout. Wrong driver
// here produces a solid white screen (panel never leaves its reset/idle
// state because the init command sequence doesn't match the controller).
// If yours is the older ILI9341 variant, swap ST7789_DRIVER back to
// ILI9341_DRIVER and TFT_RGB_ORDER back to TFT_RGB.

// Guarded rather than hard-defined so a build can override it from the
// command line: [env:cyd-fast] in platformio.ini passes
// -DSPI_FREQUENCY=80000000 and everything else about that build is
// identical to [env:cyd]. That is why there is no duplicate copy of this
// header for the overclocked variant -- and, usefully, a -D flag change
// forces a rebuild, where editing this file does not (it arrives via
// -include, which PlatformIO's dependency scanner cannot see).
//
// 80MHz is an overclock, not a spec-compliant setting: the ST7789's
// rated write cycle is ~16ns, about 62.5MHz. It is widely used on these
// boards but board-dependent -- trace quality varies unit to unit, and
// the failure modes (white screen, torn lines, colour corruption) look
// identical to the wrong-driver problem this board already has a
// support burden around. The ESP32 SPI divider snaps to 80/40/26.7/20,
// so there is no intermediate value to retreat to: it is 40 or 80.
//
// Measured on real hardware. At 40MHz: push 38ms, frame 44.4ms (22fps).
// At 80MHz: push 22.6ms, frame 29ms (34fps). Only ~30.7ms of the 40MHz
// push is the bus itself (153,600 bytes at 16bpp); the remaining ~7.3ms
// is the 8bpp->RGB565 palette conversion, which is CPU-bound and does
// not scale with this clock -- which is why 80MHz gives ~1.7x, not 2x.
