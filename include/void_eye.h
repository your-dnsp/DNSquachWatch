// SquachWatch-CYD -- baked geometry for the VOID EYE outfit.
//
// The costume replaces his head with a sphere of deep space: a star field
// streaming outward from the middle, an iris that flicks around over it, and
// a fur lid that closes on a blink. None of that is allowed to compute a
// sine, a cosine or a square root on the draw path -- Squachy is redrawn
// every frame into the shared 8-bit sprite, so anything per-star per-frame is
// paid ~46 times a frame forever.
//
// Same reasoning and the same shape as CAUSTIC_TILE next door: `static const`
// at file scope lands in .rodata, which is memory-mapped on ESP32 and read
// directly, so this costs ~250 bytes of the spare flash and nothing at all of
// the heap -- the resource that is actually tight here.
//
// STAR_DX/DY are unit directions in 64ths (so |v| <= 64), STAR_PH staggers the
// stars so they do not all recycle on the same frame, and RSTEP is a
// square-root ramp of the radius in 64ths of the sphere. The ramp is what
// makes this read as a warp field rather than a drifting cloud: a star walking
// RSTEP at a constant phase speed accelerates as it goes, and because the
// square root spreads the samples by area, the field stays evenly dense
// instead of bunching in the middle the way a linear ramp does.
//
//   rad = RSTEP[(phase + STAR_PH[i]) & 63];
//   x   = cx + (STAR_DX[i] * rad * r) / 4096;
//
// Division, not a shift: the product is signed and a right shift on a
// negative value is not portable.
