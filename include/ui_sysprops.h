// SquachWatch-CYD — SYSTEM PROPERTIES: the window that says an update is out.
//
// It stands in front of the main screen on the first frame after the intro,
// whenever the boot check or a squad member turned up something newer. It
// exists because the old announcement was a line Squachy spoke, and two
// boards in the room talking to each other painted over it before it could
// be read. A window waits instead: nothing else draws until it is answered.
//
// Three tabs, each backed by something the board actually knows -- a tab
// with nothing behind it would be decoration:
//   UPDATE  what is running, what is out, where it was heard, and the button
//   BOARD   the build, both slots, uptime and heap -- DIAGNOSTICS in brief
//   CREDITS DNSP authorship, upstream attribution and original firmware link
