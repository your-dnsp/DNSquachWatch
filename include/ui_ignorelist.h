// SquachWatch-CYD — ignored-devices screen, reached via Settings'

// things you turn off, one tap per row.
//
// The list is short by construction (IgnoreList::MAX is 64) and is
// usually far shorter, so there is no search or paging here -- scrolling
// a handful of rows is the whole interaction.
