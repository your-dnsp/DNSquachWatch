// SquachWatch-CYD — wall-clock time
//
// Everything with a timestamp on it used to be counting from boot. A log
// row reading "71581:47" is 71581 minutes since the board powered up,
// which tells you the order things happened in and nothing else -- and the
// diary, which is supposed to be a record of days, could not name one.
//
// HOW IT GETS SET. The board is a passive sniffer and never associates with
// an access point on its own -- except for the two moments it already
// does: the update check at boot and UPDATE OVER WIFI. Both join the saved
// network anyway, so the clock rides along: SNTP starts the moment the join
// succeeds and is stopped again with the radio. A board with no saved
// network can still be told the time over serial (TIME <epoch>, at the
// documented 2,000,000 baud). Either way the clock is SET rather than
// continuously synced, and it is honest about not knowing: unset,
// everything falls back to uptime exactly as before.
//
// It survives a reboot, which is the case that matters most: the ESP32
// keeps system time across a software reset, so a watchdog or a panic (or
// the SD-card boot loop) does not lose it. Pulling the power does, until
// the next boot check puts it back.
//
// The zone is the user's to pick (TIME ZONE on the DESK MODE page): a POSIX
// rule per zone, so daylight saving flips itself.
