// What the board saw and how it last went down, kept across restarts without
// an SD card. It lives in the 128 KB the partition table leaves unassigned
// between app1 and the core dump (0x3D0000-0x3F0000): no table change, so no
// board needs a USB reinstall to have it. See partitions_ota.csv.
//
// Two rings of 4 KB sectors, each sector a header and 63 records of 64 bytes:
//   sectors 0-1   boots: one record a boot, with the crash details when the
//                 boot was a crash -- about a hundred boots back
//   sectors 2-31  detections: one record a sighting, first sight or back
//                 after going quiet -- about 1,800 back
// A full ring erases its oldest sector. Nothing here is trusted until its
// header and checksum say it is ours: before v1.7.0 this space was SPIFFS,
// so an old board arrives with somebody else's bytes in it.
//
// Called from loop() and setup() only, never from the Bluetooth host task: a
// flash write stalls both cores, and a sector erase stalls them for tens of
// milliseconds.
