// SquachWatch-CYD — the messages tutorial.
//
// Seven cards that walk through messaging with a pretend visitor, one tap at
// a time so there is time to read each one. It starts by itself the first time
// MESSAGES is switched on, and the "?" on the message screen replays it.
//
// It spans two screens -- the main screen, where the visitor stands and the
// speech bubble is, and the message screen, where a line is picked and sent --
// so the step lives here and each screen asks it what to draw and what a tap
// means.
//
// NOTHING IN IT TRANSMITS. The visitor is drawn from a local stand-in, SEND
// moves the lesson on without calling MeshTalk, and the reply is painted, not
// received. That is what makes it safe to run before anybody has a phrase, and
// it must stay that way: the whole premise of SquachMesh is that the radio does
// nothing the owner did not agree to.
