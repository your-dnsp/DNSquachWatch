// Every screen draws into one 8-bit sprite. Measured on the board (PRIM on
// the console), the library's horizontal line and filled rectangle are fine
// -- a memset -- but three things are not:
//
//   drawPixel       0.29 us each: fine alone, ruinous when something plots
//                   pixel by pixel, which the next two do
//   drawFastVLine   80 ns a pixel for a plain store, because its loop
//                   re-multiplies the row stride every pixel (the compiler
//                   cannot prove the store does not change the stride)
//   drawLine        35 us for a hundred pixels: one fully clipped call per
//                   run of one or two pixels
//   text            19 us a character at size 1, 50 at size 2: 48 drawPixel
//                   calls, or 48 fillRects, per character of the built-in
//                   font -- and this device is mostly text
//
// All of those are virtual, so this subclass takes them over for the one
// sprite the firmware has: same clipping, same viewport datum, same colour
// conversion, same Bresenham, same font table, but writing bytes into the
// buffer with a local pointer and stride instead of going through a clipped
// call per pixel. Anything that is not the plain 8-bit case -- another depth,
// a custom font, a character or line that crosses the viewport edge -- is
// handed straight back to the library, which is how the clipping stays its
// clipping rather than a second implementation of it.
//
// selfCheck() is the proof: it draws the same patterns through the library
// path and this one, edge cases and a viewport included, and compares
// checksums of the whole buffer. PRIM on the console runs it.
//
// The emulator's sprite is a different class with none of these members, so
// there this is a plain pass-through and nothing changes.

    // the 3.5" pushes its main screen through a 480x320 viewport laid over a
    // 480x160 buffer. Anything that walks the buffer row by row has to ask
    // here or it reads straight off the end -- a LoadStoreError panic, found
    // on that board on 2026-09-20 and the reason FramePush::push() takes a
    // buffer and a size rather than a sprite.

    // The window-write guard. TFT_eSprite::setWindow() clamps the window it
    // is handed to width()/height(), and those report the VIEWPORT, not the
    // buffer -- so on a 480x160 buffer under a 480x320 viewport it will
    // happily accept row 319 and let pushColor() store at _img8[319*480],
    // 76 KB past the end of the allocation.
    //
    // That is a real crash, not a theoretical one: TFT_eSPI::drawWedgeLine()
    // (behind drawWideLine, which the art uses) starts its scan at the line's
    // RAW start row -- clipWindow() crops the end of the range but never the
    // start -- and feeds it straight to setWindow(). On every other board the
    // viewport IS the buffer and the datum is zero, so raw equals clipped and
    // this has been correct for years. Only the two-band buffer separates
    // them, which is why this is built for that board alone.
    //
    // The fix is the library's own logic against the right numbers: a window
    // wholly outside the buffer goes to the spare pixel callocSprite() puts
    // at the end for exactly this purpose, and one that overlaps is cropped
    // to the buffer. pushColor() wraps back to the window's start when it
    // runs off the end, so a cropped window can never walk out of it.
    //
    // It stops the corruption; it does not make a drawWideLine() land in the
    // right band, because that call reads the datum inconsistently to begin
    // with. Art drawn into the band sprite wants the four virtual primitives.
