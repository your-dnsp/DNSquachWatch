// SquachWatch-CYD — the optional PIN lock.
//
// What it protects, stated plainly because the UI says it too: people at the
// table, not someone with a USB cable. A 4-8 digit PIN is a space of 10^4 to
// 10^8, brute-forceable offline in seconds, and the message phrase and key sit
// in flash that a cable can read. So this stops a snoop picking the device up,
// and nothing more -- the lock screen says as much when the PIN is first set.
//
// The digits are never stored: a random 8-byte salt and SHA-256(salt||pin) are,
// and the same for the optional duress PIN. All of this is pure arithmetic over
// NVS and a hash, so it builds and is tested on a desktop with no radio and no
// display -- test/security_test.cpp covers the backoff, the duress path and
// which state a wipe leaves behind.
