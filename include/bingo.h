// SquachWatch-CYD — detection bingo
//
// A card of sixteen detection types. A type marks its square the first time
// the board sees one this week; four in a row is a line; sixteen is a full
// card. A fresh card every week, and a streak for weeks finished.
//
// The game the board was always half playing: it already counts every type
// it has ever seen, and the rare ones (a gunshot sensor, a plate reader)
// were numbers that never moved. This gives them a reason to.
//
// Cheap on purpose: the card is sixteen bytes, the marks sixteen more, and
// nothing here runs per frame. note() is called from the detection path on
// the Bluetooth host task and only touches RAM; tick(), from loop(), is what
// writes to flash.
