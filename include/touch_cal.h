// SquachWatch-CYD — persistent touch calibration
// Touch-type-agnostic: works for the resistive XPT2046 (on its own bus or
// the display's) and the capacitive CST816/820 alike, since all of them
// reduce to two raw numbers per touch. The caller supplies a raw-sample
// reader; the mapping from those numbers to the screen is a TouchFit::Fit
// (see touch_fit.h), the same on every board and good for every rotation.
