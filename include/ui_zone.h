// picked a zone: the board is on UTC and every hour-of-day line would be
// wrong. The zone name, the live time in it, and three buttons. THIS IS
// RIGHT stores the choice and the card never comes back; the arrows cycle
// the same table the SYSTEM row uses. Taps outside the card fall through to
// the main screen, and an alert still takes the screen over it.
