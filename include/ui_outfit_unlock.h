// that scales open, the per-letter rainbow reveal, the dismiss guard.
//
// It exists at all because the pet was the one unlock with no card. A hat
// got a celebration; a whole companion got a single line in his bubble --
// and unlocking the pet also makes a settings row APPEAR that was hidden
// until then, which nothing told you about. The footer is that fix.
