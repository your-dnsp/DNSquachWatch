// consequences -- one shows you other people's Squachys, the other tells
// everybody with a scanner that you are here -- and collapsing them into a
// single ON/OFF was reported as broken twice before it was split.
//
// It also buys a row back on the Settings screen, which carries twenty-five
// and has three that collide in portrait: the NAME row moved in here, so two
// rows out there became one.
//
// Deliberately not scrollable. Seven rows fit, and a list that cannot
// overflow does not need the gesture -- see uiDetFilterScroll for the one
// that does.
