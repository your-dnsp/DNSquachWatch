// The board as the thing beside the keyboard: the time, large; the date;
// Squachy underneath, chattering as he does on CLEAR; and a focus timer
// (25 minutes on, 5 off) that he counts down with the light on the back.
// Detection keeps running behind it and an alert still takes the screen;
// this is a place to leave the board, not a mode that switches anything off.
//
// Reached from Settings' DESK MODE row. The power saver does not dim this
// screen: a clock that goes dark is a clock that is not there.
