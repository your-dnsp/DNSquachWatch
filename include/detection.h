    // First BSSID seen beaconing each SSID, with the security posture it
    // advertised. A later beacon for that SSID from different hardware
    // *and* disagreeing about encryption is flagged EVILTWIN.
    //
    // The encryption mismatch is the real test, and it exists because
    // the obvious one doesn't work. "Same SSID, different BSSID" is not
    // a rogue -- it is also every mesh network and every dual-band AP,
    // and confirmed on a real mesh here it fires constantly. Even "same
    // SSID, different OUI" over-fires, because vendors ship across
    // several OUI blocks.
    //
    // What a mesh never does is disagree with itself about security:
    // every node on one SSID advertises the same Privacy bit. An evil
    // twin usually must disagree -- cloning a WPA network without the
    // key gets an attacker nothing, so the practical attack is an open
    // twin of an encrypted network, which is exactly what a captive
    // "evil portal" is.
    //
    // The cost, stated plainly: an attacker who advertises matching
    // encryption walks past this. That attacker also can't complete a
    // handshake, so it's a much rarer attack than the one this catches.
    //
