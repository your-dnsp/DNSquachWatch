// SquachWatch-CYD — the pet.
//
// VAPOR SHAGGY, promoted from the cameo who crosses the flying toasters to
// something that turns up on the CLEAR screen, climbs Squachy, insults him
// and leaves. Drawn at four device pixels an art pixel rather than the
// cameo's two, which is the size where a speech bubble beside him reads as
// HIS rather than as one of Squachy's.
//
// "Pet" is the user-facing word. Internally this is the companion, because
// squachy.cpp already uses s_petCount for how many times you have STROKED
// him, and one file with both meanings of the word would be a trap.
