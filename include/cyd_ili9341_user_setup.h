// SquachWatch-CYD — TFT_eSPI user setup (ILI9341 variant)
// Some ESP32-2432S028R ("CYD") batches ship the older ILI9341 panel
// instead of ST7789 -- same 2.8"/240x320 glass and pinout, different
// controller. Wrong driver produces a solid white screen (panel never
// leaves its reset/idle state because the init command sequence
// doesn't match the controller), which is exactly why this exists as
// its own build instead of a single guess: see cyd_user_setup.h (the
// ST7789 variant, the more commonly reported one) for that side of it.
// Identical to that file except the two lines called out below.
