// SquachWatch-CYD — TFT_eSPI user setup for the AWOK 2.4" board
// (JustCallMeKoko ESP32 Marauder V6.1 hardware — WROOM-32 module,
// ILI9341 240x320 panel, XPT2046 resistive touch and SD card sharing
// the display's VSPI bus). Cross-referenced against the AWOK 2.4"
// board turnover doc and the ESP32-Marauder V6.1 stock repo's own
// User_Setup.h — this is the vendor's config for the exact PCB.
//
// Unlike the 2.8" CYD variants this repo also supports, the 2.4" AWOK
// uses the plain ILI9341_DRIVER (NOT the _2 variant that Marauder MINI
// and some cheap CYDs use — the _2 init sequence leaves this panel
// blank/white on real hardware, per the turnover doc). CS/DC are 17/16,
// NOT the 27/26 that Marauder MINI uses.

// display clock speed directly drives animation smoothness). Both CYD
// boards run their display at 40 MHz, including cyd35 which shares its
// touch bus with the display the same way this board does -- trying
// that here too. If the display goes black under WiFi/BLE load (a
// real, documented ESP32 phenomenon: dynamic APB clock scaling can
// perturb the SPI clock divider), drop back toward 27 MHz or the
// stock repo's fallback of 20 MHz.

// Fonts. Only the built-in GLCD font (font 1) is loaded: nothing in
// this project ever calls setTextFont(), setFreeFont() or loadFont(),
// and there are no .vlw assets -- every screen uses font 1 via
// setTextSize(), and the one custom typeface (Bangers, on the ALERT
// and CLEAR headings) ships as its own glyph tables in
// include/bangers_font.h rather than through TFT_eSPI at all.
// LOAD_FONT2/4/6/7/8 and SMOOTH_FONT were ~11KB of glyph data plus the
// .vlw renderer that nothing could reach.

// And font 2, the 16-row proportional face, for the speech bubbles: the
// 6x8 font was a squint on a 2.4" screen and the only other size it comes
// in is double. About 3 KB of glyphs.
// NOTE: editing this file does not rebuild the library -- delete
// .pio/build/<env>/lib*/TFT_eSPI first, or the board runs the old config.

// IMPORTANT: TFT_INVERSION_ON/OFF here does NOT control this board's
// actual inversion polarity -- main.cpp's tft.invertDisplay() call in
// setup() overwrites whatever this sets, unconditionally, for every
// board. The real switch is PANEL_NEEDS_INVERSION in main.cpp's
// setup(), not this define (several rounds of flipping this on real
// hardware with zero visible effect is what found that). Left here at
// its default only because TFT_eSPI expects one of the two to be
// defined; change PANEL_NEEDS_INVERSION in main.cpp instead if colors
// still look wrong.
#define TFT_INVERSION_OFF
// RGB vs BGR: unlike inversion above, there's no runtime override for
// this -- it's genuinely controlled by this define alone. RGB matched
// the AWOK turnover doc's nominal config but read wrong on real
// hardware once PANEL_NEEDS_INVERSION (main.cpp) was corrected to its
// actual value; trying BGR next.
