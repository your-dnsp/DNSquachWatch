// The mascot's own clock. Squachy, the pet, a visitor, the crowd and the
// idle events step once per call with no notion of elapsed time -- they were
// tuned by eye on a board that drew sixteen frames a second, and the day the
// frame rate doubled they ran at double speed. The backgrounds scale their
// motion by elapsed time and did not. So the screen draws every frame, and
// the mascot STEPS on this clock: true when at least MASCOT_STEP_MS has
// passed since the last step, and the caller hands it to every tick() as
// `advance` -- which already means "draw, but do not move" when false,
// because the 3.5" board draws twice per frame and needed exactly that.
//
// 62 ms was the pace the 80 MHz boards had before they got fast; 120 is

// console as PACE N (milliseconds a step) and kept in settings, so the
// number is chosen by eye on a real board rather than argued about.
