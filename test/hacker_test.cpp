// Two of these constants are ones the wider ecosystem gets wrong, which is
// the reason this file exists rather than trusting the table:
//
//   * ESP32 Marauder's source comments Flipper's BLE company ID as 0x0FBA.
//     0x0FBA belongs to Cosonic Intelligent Technologies, who make
//     headsets. Flipper Devices is 0x0E29 in the Bluetooth SIG list.
//   * Wall-of-Flippers checks MAC prefixes 80:E1:26 and 80:E1:27. Neither
//     appears anywhere in the IEEE registry. Only 0C:FA:22 is registered
//     to Flipper Devices Inc.
//
// Both are the same failure the Sonos entry was: a plausible constant
// copied between detectors until it looks like a fact. Pinned here so a
// future "fix" that imports them from another project turns this red.
