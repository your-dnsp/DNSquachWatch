// without moving every board that had SYNTHWAVE or BLACK saved onto
// something else. The number therefore survives its background. Two
// things have to hold for that to be safe, and neither is visible by
// reading the enum: the picker must never hand it out again, and a
// board that already had it saved must come up somewhere sensible
// rather than on a band nothing paints.
