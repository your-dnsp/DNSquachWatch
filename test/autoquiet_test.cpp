// SquachWatch-CYD — AUTO SNOOZE: when one device may interrupt again.
//
// What this guards: a device that keeps dropping out of range and coming
// back raises a fresh alert every time it returns, and after a few of those
// the board is just shouting. AUTO SNOOZE caps how many it gets for free —
// but it must never go deaf, because this is a detector, so past the cap the
// device can still interrupt by coming CLOSER than it ever has.
//
// Every rule below is one that is wrong by default if nobody writes it down:
// noise must not count as closer, the bar must be the strongest it ever
// alerted at rather than the last one, the allowance has to come back
// eventually or the device that once came nearest becomes the one you can
// never hear from again, and the WATCH target must be exempt from all of it.
