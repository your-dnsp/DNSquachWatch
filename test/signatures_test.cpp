// These are hand-maintained lists of hardware addresses, and an audit

// true: one prefix attributed to Vigilant belonged to Sonos, another to
// "Sierra" belonged to a company called SPECTRA - TEK, one labelled
// Hikvision belonged to Amazon, and a Verkada block had been added twice.
// None of that fails to compile and none of it fails at runtime -- it just
// makes the device confidently wrong.
//
// This cannot re-check the registry (CI has no business fetching 40,000
// rows on every push), so it checks the properties that hold regardless
// of what the registry says, plus a few anchors from the audit.
