"""Renders a release's show-off clip: captioned scenes, one after another.

    python3 make_show_demo.py --render-only [--clip NAME]   # under WSL, after `make`
    python  make_show_demo.py --encode-only [--clip NAME]   # wherever Pillow is installed

Every scene is a run of the one-shot emulator, so every frame is the shipping
code deciding what to draw; the caption under it is the only thing staged.
Output lands in the firmware's docs/ so the release notes can embed it from
the tag -- which is the whole reason this is a script in the repo and not a
one-off: the v1.13.0 clip was rendered from a heredoc, never copied into
docs/, and shipped in no release notes at all.

A scene is (screen, warm-up frames, captured frames, extra args, env, hold
ms, caption). A scene whose captured-frames field is a list is a scroll
sweep: one run per --scroll value, one frame each, which is how a list
scrolling to its stop is shown.

The clock is pinned (SQUACH_EPOCH) so the clip renders the same on any day.
