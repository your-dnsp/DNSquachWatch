// SquachWatch-Sim — a virtual SquachMesh peer: another SquachWatch, in the
// room, that only exists in the emulator.
//
// It does not fake the result. It builds a real SquachMesh advert and a real
// message frame and hands them to Mesh::onManufacturerData() -- the same call a
// NimBLE scan callback makes on the device -- so everything downstream is the
// firmware's own code: the decoder, the one-visitor rule, the staleness
// timeout, the consent and DETECT gates, the replay table, the red bubble. If
// a visitor does not show up here, it would not show up on a board either,
// and the status says which switch is why.
//
// It also listens. With TRANSMIT on, whatever our scan response carries is
// what it hears, opened with the same frame code a receiving board uses, and
// it can answer.
//
// The cipher underneath is still the emulator's stand-in (meshcrypto_sim.cpp),
// so this proves the plumbing and the screens, never the cryptography. That
// is pinned on hardware by the boot self-test.
