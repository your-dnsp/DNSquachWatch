// RAIN", and "LOCK BACKGROUND" into its "OFF", with the label drawn
// left-aligned and the value right-aligned into the same pixels. Size 1
// halves glyph width and gives every current row room to spare.
//
// Row *height* deliberately doesn't change with it -- rowH stays keyed
// to size 2 metrics in computeGeom() so tap targets keep their full
// height, and so hit-testing (which shares computeGeom) can't drift
// away from what was drawn.
// Label small on top, value big underneath. That way round on purpose: you
// tap these rows to change the value, so the value is the thing being read,
// and the label is the part you already know.
//
// The label keeps its group colour rather than going grey. This screen draws
// a dimmed animated background behind itself, and a low-contrast label on a
// moving backdrop is the one thing it cannot afford.
//
// `cycles` decides the arrows, and it is not decoration. BACKGROUND cycles
// in place when tapped, so it gets a pair. OUTFIT opens the outfit chooser
// instead, so it gets a single right chevron -- the same grammar the rest of
// the UI uses for "this opens something". Showing a left arrow on a row that
// cannot go left would be a lie told in pixels.
// A solid card behind every option, and a hairline around it.
//
// Rows used to rely on each print() giving its own glyph cells an opaque
// backing, so the live background showed through everywhere between the
// letters. That reads fine over the digital rain and badly over anything
// with big bright shapes -- the synthwave sun and the fire both come
// straight through the gaps in a word.
//
// Filling the row first costs nothing (the dimmed background behind this
// screen already repaints the whole body every frame, so there is no
// erase problem either way) and the 1px edge does the job the old bottom
// hairline was doing, while also closing the row off as an object.
//
