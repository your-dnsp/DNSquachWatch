// Twelve keys rather than a keyboard's twenty-nine, which is not only the
// better look. On a 320px screen twenty-nine keys means ten columns of about
// 30px; twelve means targets of 48x30. Fewer, larger targets on a resistive
// panel is the difference between typing and fighting, so the payphone is
// the more robust option as well as the more fun one.
//
// Multi-tap the way everyone over thirty already knows: 2 once is A, twice
// is B, three times is C. Uppercase only, which is free here -- every
// built-in nickname is caps and the display face is uppercase-only, so there
// is no shift key and no case handling anywhere in this file.
//
// A message gets what a phone gave a text: the digit after the letters on
// every key, punctuation on 1, and 0 after the space. A name keeps letters
// only -- it rides in the advert, and letters are what every decoder accepts.
//
// And for anybody who hates multi-tap regardless, a QWERTY board: one button
// away, and remembered once chosen. It is drawn by this same screen rather
// than a screen of its own because the text being typed lives here, and
// switching layouts mid-word keeps what you have typed -- which is the entire
// point of a bailout. Its geometry, hit test and touch filter are pure
// arithmetic in qwerty.cpp, host-tested against every pixel of both
// rotations and both boards.
