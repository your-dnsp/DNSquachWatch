// was expired in the same call that queued it. Measured: at=20549, now=20541,
// age=4294967288. The emulator could not reproduce it because its clock does
// not move within a frame, and the sender never hit it because its own emote
// is queued on one iteration and checked on the next, when `now` has caught
// up. The signed form treats a stamp from the near future as an age of zero,
