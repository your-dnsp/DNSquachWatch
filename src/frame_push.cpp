// the counters and the buttons -- about a third -- repainted identically
// every frame by code that does not know they did not change.
//
// Rows are remembered by their PANEL row, not their row within the sprite.
// The 3.5" draws its main screen in two bands -- one half-height sprite
// pushed twice, at the top of the screen and then halfway down -- and a
// record indexed within the sprite would have the second band reading the
// first band's rows and skipping whatever happened to match. Indexing by
// (y + row) gives each band its own half of the record and costs nothing.
//
// The record is only as good as its last full push, so it is thrown away
// (invalidate()) whenever anything else could have touched the panel -- a
// rotation, a fall-back to the ordinary push -- and every 64th frame is a
// full one regardless, so nothing that slips past that can stay on screen
// for more than three seconds.

// The ESP32-C5's SPI clock, raised from inside the transaction.
//
// WHAT THE DEFAULT COSTS. Measured on an NM-CYD-C5: a full 320x240 push takes
// 82.2 ms, which is 0.343 ms per row and an effective 14.9 Mbit/s. Splitting
// that budget showed the CPU is barely in it -- the LUT conversion is 0.011 ms
// per row and all sixteen SPI_W register writes together are 0.012 ms (75 ns
// each) -- so 93% of the time is spent waiting for the wire.
//
// WHY IT IS SLOW, from the C5 TRM rather than by experiment. Ch.33.7 gives
// f_SPI = f_clk_spi_mst / ((SPI_CLKCNT_N + 1)(SPI_CLKDIV_PRE + 1)), and
// PCR_SPI2_CLKM_SEL (ch.9) defaults to XTAL_CLK, which is 48 MHz on this chip.
// The bus comes up at N=2: 48/3 = 16 MHz, which is exactly the 14.9 Mbit/s
// measured. Setting SPI_CLK_EQU_SYSCLK instead takes the module clock
// undivided.
//
// WHY IT HAS TO BE HERE, rather than in the board's user setup. SPI_FREQUENCY
// genuinely does nothing on this path: TFT_eSPI's begin_tft_write() calls
// spi.beginTransaction(SPISettings(SPI_FREQUENCY, ..)), which REWRITES
// SPI_CLOCK_REG -- so a divisor set before tft.startWrite() is overwritten
// before a single pixel moves. Built at 20, 40 and 80 MHz the register came
// back 0x00002001 every time. Set inside the transaction, it holds, and the
// next beginTransaction anywhere else (touch, SD) restores its own setting, so
// nothing outside this push is affected.
//
// MEASURED, same board, same frame, divisor set here:
//     N=3  12 MHz  107.9 ms   9.3 fps
//     N=2  16 MHz   82.2 ms  12.2 fps   <- the default
//     N=1  24 MHz   56.6 ms  17.7 fps
//     N=0  48 MHz   30.9 ms  32.4 fps   <- this
// Linear in the divisor, which is the proof that the wire was the ceiling.
//
// If a panel ever turns out not to like 48 MHz -- the symptom is torn or
// speckled rows, not a blank screen -- build with -DSQW_C5_SPI_DIV=1 for
// 24 MHz. Do not raise it further: 0 is already the undivided module clock.
// GOING FURTHER THAN THE DIVIDER: the module clock's SOURCE.
// PCR_SPI2_CLKM_CONF_REG (soc/pcr_reg.h, TRM ch.9) selects it at bits [21:20]
// -- 0 = XTAL_CLK, which is the 48 MHz default and the ceiling everything
// above runs into, 1 = PLL_F160M_CLK -- with an 8-bit divider at [19:12].
// PLL_F160M over two is an 80 MHz module clock, and undivided that is 80 MHz
// on the wire. Measured on the same frame: 20.5 ms, 48.8 fps, 60.0 Mbit/s,
// against 82.2 ms and 12.2 fps as shipped. Two different routes to 80 MHz
// (PLL/2 with N=0, and PLL/1 with N=1) gave identical times, which is the
// cross-check that the number is real.
//
// THE SOURCE IS RESTORED BEFORE THIS FUNCTION RETURNS, and that is not
// tidiness. PCR_SPI2_CLKM_SEL is global to SPI2, and on this board the
// XPT2046 touch controller and the SD card are on that same peripheral.
// Arduino's beginTransaction() works out its divisors believing the source is
// the crystal, so leaving the PLL selected would silently run every later
// transaction at 3.3x its requested frequency -- touch at 8 MHz against a
// rated 2.5 MHz, and an SD card at 13 MHz instead of 4. Nothing would report
// an error; touch would just start missing presses. Raised here, restored
// here, and only ever while this file owns the bus.
