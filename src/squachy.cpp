// to protect a pose that lasts 900ms, cannot repeat for 30 seconds (see the
// cooldown by s_duckUntil), and only fires when a flying toaster passes his
// head -- one background out of eleven. Mid-crouch his soles now reach about
// six rows into the first counter line, behind cyan text that is drawn after
// him and covers it. That is a fair price for a tenth of him at rest.

// there is nothing left worth sacrificing: 8 covers his whole silhouette,
// and it costs almost nothing because the top is no longer where he runs

// everyone else. This is what he gets instead: one sheet of flame wrapped
// round him from one foot, up over his head, and down to the other, drawn
// behind him so his own body covers its inner edge. Nothing sits on his head,
// so he is full size, and it needs fitting to no costume.
//
// The sheet is a strip. Its inner edge is a path just inside his outline
// (AURA_PATH). Its outer edge is that path pushed outward, and along it runs
// a row of gold licks, each thrown up and out, whose lengths ride a sawtooth
// that climbs both sides from his feet to the peak. That climbing is what
// makes the edge lick like fire instead of standing still like a collar.
//
// It fades across its width, blue against him to gold at the edge. A panel
// with four levels of blue cannot blend that, so it is bands: deep blue,
// azure, ice and pale yellow in the body, gold in the licks. Going by way of
// the pale ones is what keeps the middle from turning the grey-green a
// straight mix of blue and gold gives.
//
// Thirteen separate tongues of fire stood round him came first. They read as
// thirteen things.
//
// It follows his mood, as YZZERD's magic does: startled by a detection it
// stands half as tall again and flickers twice as fast, and rings of light
// run out along the floor; asleep it sinks to a low blue pilot light and lets
// go of no embers.
//
// Nothing is stored: every length is a function of the clock, so a banded
// board draws both halves of him alike.
